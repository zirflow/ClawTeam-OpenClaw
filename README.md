> **Fork of [HKUDS/ClawTeam](https://github.com/HKUDS/ClawTeam)** maintained by [Zirflow](https://zirflow.com). Deep OpenClaw integration with production reliability fixes, race condition patches, and enterprise-ready hardening. All upstream fixes are synced.

You set the goal. The agent swarm handles the rest — spawning workers, splitting tasks, coordinating, and merging results.

Works with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (default), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), and any CLI agent.

## Platform Support

- Linux and macOS keep the original `tmux`-first workflow.
- Windows 10/11 is supported with an automatic fallback to the `subprocess` backend.
- Task locking, process liveness checks, and signal registration are routed through a shared compatibility layer so unsupported Unix-only behavior degrades safely on Windows.
- `board attach` still requires `tmux`, so on Windows prefer `clawteam board serve` for live monitoring.
- If you want the original tmux workflow on Windows, run ClawTeam inside WSL.

## 🎯 Maintained by Zirflow 臻孚

**ClawTeam-OpenClaw** is deeply maintained by [Zirflow 臻孚](https://zirflow.com) — a team building production-ready AI agent infrastructure.

This fork adds critical production reliability fixes not found in upstream:

| Fix | Why it matters |
|-----|---------------|
| **EXIT Protocol** | Worker panes reliably close after task completion — no zombie panes |
| **subprocess backend** | Bash workers run independently without main agent routing (<2s spawn) |
| **spawn_timeout 30s** | Fast fail when workers hang — don't wait 2 minutes |
| **spawn_ready_timeout 2s** | Workers start in <2s instead of 30s |
| **remain-on-exit off** | Dead panes disappear immediately |
| **OpenClaw skill-ready** | Drop-in SKILL.md for OpenClaw agent installation |

**🚀 For AI Agent Teams**: See [Install → For OpenClaw Agents](#for-openclaw-agents) below.

**👤 For Humans**: See [Install → One-Line Install](#one-line-install) below.

---

## Why ClawTeam?

Current AI agents are powerful but work in **isolation**. ClawTeam lets agents self-organize into teams — splitting work, communicating, and converging on results without human micromanagement.

| | ClawTeam | Other multi-agent frameworks |
|---|---------|----------------------------|
| **Who uses it** | The AI agents themselves | Humans writing orchestration code |
| **Setup** | `pip install` + one prompt | Docker, cloud APIs, YAML configs |
| **Infrastructure** | Filesystem + tmux | Redis, message queues, databases |
| **Agent support** | Any CLI agent | Framework-specific only |
| **Isolation** | Git worktrees (real branches) | Containers or virtual envs |

---

## How It Works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

### Agents Spawn Agents
The leader calls `clawteam spawn` to create workers. Each gets its own **git worktree**, **spawn backend session**, and **identity**.

```bash
clawteam spawn --team my-team \
  --agent-name worker1 \
  --task "Implement auth module"
```

</td>
<td width="33%">

### Agents Talk to Agents
Workers check inboxes, update tasks, and report results — all through CLI commands **auto-injected** into their prompt.

```bash
clawteam task list my-team --owner me
clawteam inbox send my-team leader \
  "Auth done. All tests passing."
```

</td>
<td width="33%">

### You Just Watch
Monitor the swarm from a tiled tmux view or Web UI. The leader handles coordination.

```bash
clawteam board serve --port 8080
# Or, on Linux/macOS/WSL with tmux:
clawteam board attach my-team
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Let the Agent Drive (Recommended)

Install ClawTeam, then prompt your agent:

```
"Build a web app. Use clawteam to split the work across multiple agents."
```

The agent auto-creates a team, spawns workers, assigns tasks, and coordinates — all via `clawteam` CLI.

### Option 2: Drive It Manually

```bash
# Create a team
clawteam team spawn-team my-team -d "Build the auth module" -n leader

# Spawn workers — each gets a git worktree plus its own backend session
clawteam spawn --team my-team --agent-name alice --task "Implement OAuth2 flow"
clawteam spawn --team my-team --agent-name bob   --task "Write unit tests for auth"

# Watch them work
clawteam board serve --port 8080
clawteam board attach my-team   # Linux/macOS/WSL with tmux
```

### Supported Agents

| Agent | Spawn Command | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) | `clawteam spawn --team ...` | **Default** |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) | `clawteam spawn claude --team ...` | Full support |
| [Codex](https://openai.com/codex) | `clawteam spawn codex --team ...` | Full support |
| [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) | `clawteam spawn nanobot --team ...` | Full support |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com) | `clawteam spawn subprocess cursor --team ...` | Experimental |
| Custom scripts | `clawteam spawn subprocess python --team ...` | Full support |

---

## Install

### Step 1: Prerequisites

ClawTeam requires **Python 3.10+** and at least one CLI coding agent (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, etc.). On Linux/macOS, the full visual workflow also requires **tmux**. On Windows, `tmux` is optional because ClawTeam defaults to the `subprocess` backend.

**Check what you already have:**

```bash
python --version    # Need 3.10+
tmux -V             # Linux/macOS/WSL only
openclaw --version  # Or: claude --version / codex --version
```

**Install missing prerequisites:**

| Tool | Windows | macOS | Ubuntu/Debian |
|------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Python 3.10+ | Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) | `brew install python@3.12` | `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip` |
| tmux | Optional | `brew install tmux` | `sudo apt install tmux` |
| OpenClaw | `pip install openclaw` | `pip install openclaw` | `pip install openclaw` |

> If using Claude Code or Codex instead of OpenClaw, install those per their own docs. OpenClaw is the default but not strictly required.

On Windows, after installation you can verify the backend choice with:

```powershell
clawteam config get default_backend
```

### Windows Native Setup

Use this path for PowerShell or Windows Terminal:

```powershell
py -3 -m pip install -e .
clawteam config get default_backend   # should print subprocess
clawteam spawn --team demo --agent-name worker1 --task "Do work"
clawteam board serve --port 8080
```

If you want the full tmux experience, install and run ClawTeam inside WSL instead.

### Step 2: Install ClawTeam

> **⚠️ Do NOT run `pip install clawteam` or `npm install -g clawteam` directly:**
> - `pip install clawteam` installs the upstream PyPI version, which defaults to `claude` and lacks OpenClaw adaptations.
> - `npm install -g clawteam` installs an unrelated name-squatting package (by `a9logic`). If `clawteam --version` shows "Coming Soon", you have the wrong one — run `npm uninstall -g clawteam`.
>
> **Use the three commands below — the `pip install -e .` step is required. It installs from the local repo, not from PyPI.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zirflow/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git
cd ClawTeam-OpenClaw
pip install -e .    # ← Required! Installs from local repo, NOT the same as pip install clawteam
```

Optional — P2P transport (ZeroMQ):

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[p2p]"
```

### Step 3: Ensure `clawteam` is on PATH

Spawned agents run in fresh shells that may not have pip's bin directory in PATH. A symlink in `~/bin` ensures `clawteam` is always reachable:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -sf "$(which clawteam)" ~/bin/clawteam
```

If `which clawteam` returns nothing, find the binary manually:

```bash
# Common locations:
# ~/.local/bin/clawteam
# /opt/homebrew/bin/clawteam
# /usr/local/bin/clawteam
# /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.*/bin/clawteam
find / -name clawteam -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

Then ensure `~/bin` is in your PATH — add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` if it isn't:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

On native Windows, you usually do not need the `~/bin` symlink step. Instead, make sure the Python `Scripts` directory containing `clawteam.exe` is on `PATH`, or activate the virtual environment where you installed ClawTeam before spawning agents.

### Step 4: Install the OpenClaw skill (OpenClaw users only)

The skill file teaches OpenClaw agents how to use ClawTeam through natural language. Skip this step if you're not using OpenClaw.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawteam
cp skills/openclaw/SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawteam/SKILL.md
```

### Step 5: Configure exec approvals (OpenClaw users only)

Spawned OpenClaw agents need permission to run `clawteam` commands. Without this, agents will block on interactive permission prompts.

```bash
# Ensure security mode is "allowlist" (not "full")
python3 -c "
import json, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path.home() / '.openclaw' / 'exec-approvals.json'
if p.exists():
    d = json.loads(p.read_text())
    d.setdefault('defaults', {})['security'] = 'allowlist'
    p.write_text(json.dumps(d, indent=2))
    print('exec-approvals.json updated: security = allowlist')
else:
    print('exec-approvals.json not found — run openclaw once first, then re-run this step')
"

# Add clawteam to the allowlist (use the absolute path — OpenClaw 4.2+ requires it)
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent "*" "$(which clawteam)"
```

> If `openclaw approvals` fails, the OpenClaw gateway may not be running. Start it first, then retry.

### Step 6: Verify

```bash
clawteam --version          # Should print version
clawteam config health      # Should show all green
```

If using OpenClaw, also verify the skill is loaded:

```bash
openclaw skills list | grep clawteam
```

### Automated installer

Steps 2–6 above are also available as a single script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zirflow/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git
cd ClawTeam-OpenClaw
bash scripts/install-openclaw.sh
```

This script is intended for Linux, macOS, and WSL shells, not native PowerShell.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `clawteam: command not found` | pip bin dir not in PATH | Run Step 3 and ensure either `~/bin` or your Python `Scripts` directory is on PATH |
| Spawned agents can't find `clawteam` | Agents run in fresh shells without pip PATH | Verify `clawteam` is on PATH in new shells; on Windows check the Python `Scripts` directory or active virtualenv |
| `openclaw approvals` fails | Gateway not running | Start `openclaw gateway` first, then retry Step 5 |
| `exec-approvals.json not found` | OpenClaw never ran | Run `openclaw` once to generate config, then retry Step 5 |
| Agents block on permission prompts | Exec approvals security is "full" | Run Step 5 to switch to "allowlist" |
| `pip install -e .` fails | Missing build deps | Run `pip install hatchling` first |
| `clawteam --version` shows "Coming Soon" | Installed the npm name-squatting package (`a9logic`, unrelated to this project) | `npm uninstall -g clawteam`, then reinstall per Step 2 |

### For OpenClaw Agents 🦞

Install ClawTeam as an OpenClaw skill so your AI agents can spawn multi-agent swarms:

```bash
# Method A: Clone + pip install (full setup, recommended)
git clone https://github.com/zirflow/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git /path/to/ClawTeam-OpenClaw
cd /path/to/ClawTeam-OpenClaw
pip install -e .

# Then copy SKILL.md to your OpenClaw agent's skills directory:
cp SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawteam/SKILL.md
```

Or, in an OpenClaw agent conversation, the agent can run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zirflow/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git /tmp/ClawTeam-OpenClaw
pip install -e /tmp/ClawTeam-OpenClaw --break-system-packages
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawteam
cp /tmp/ClawTeam-OpenClaw/skills/openclaw/SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawteam/
```

> **Trigger phrases** that activate ClawTeam skill:  
> `team`, `swarm`, `multi-agent`, `clawteam`, `spawn agents`, `parallel agents`, `agent team`, `use clawteam to...`, `split work across agents`

After installation, the agent can self-coordinate a team by simply being told the goal:
```
"Build a web app. Use clawteam to split the work across multiple agents."
```

### One-Line Install 👤

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zirflow/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git && cd ClawTeam-OpenClaw && pip install -e . && mkdir -p ~/bin && ln -sf "$(which clawteam)" ~/bin/clawteam && echo "✅ ClawTeam installed: $(clawteam --version)"
```

Or without cloning (requires Git):

```bash
pip install -e "git+https://github.com/zirflow/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git#egg=clawteam" --break-system-packages
mkdir -p ~/bin && ln -sf "$(which clawteam)" ~/bin/clawteam
```


## Use Cases

### 1. Autonomous ML Research — 8 Agents x 8 GPUs

Based on [@karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch). One prompt launches 8 research agents across H100s that design 2000+ experiments autonomously.

```
Human: "Use 8 GPUs to optimize train.py. Read program.md for instructions."

Leader agent:
├── Spawns 8 agents, each assigned a research direction (depth, width, LR, batch size...)
├── Each agent gets its own git worktree for isolated experiments
├── Every 30 min: checks results, cross-pollinates best configs to new agents
├── Reassigns GPUs as agents finish — fresh agents start from best known config
└── Result: val_bpb 1.044 → 0.977 (6.4% improvement) across 2430 experiments in ~30 GPU-hours
```

Full results: [novix-science/autoresearch](https://github.com/novix-science/autoresearch)

### 2. Agentic Software Engineering

```
Human: "Build a full-stack todo app with auth, database, and React frontend."

Leader agent:
├── Creates tasks with dependency chains (API schema → auth + DB → frontend → tests)
├── Spawns 5 agents (architect, 2 backend, frontend, tester) in separate worktrees
├── Dependencies auto-resolve: architect completes → backend unblocks → tester unblocks
├── Agents coordinate via inbox: "Here's the OpenAPI spec", "Auth endpoints ready"
└── Leader merges all worktrees into main when complete
```

### 3. AI Hedge Fund — Template Launch

A TOML template spawns a complete 7-agent investment team with one command:

```bash
clawteam launch hedge-fund --team fund1 --goal "Analyze AAPL, MSFT, NVDA for Q2 2026"
```

5 analyst agents (value, growth, technical, fundamentals, sentiment) work in parallel. Risk manager synthesizes all signals. Portfolio manager makes final decisions.

Templates are TOML files — **create your own** for any domain.

## OpenClaw Integration

This fork makes [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) the **default agent**. Without ClawTeam, each OpenClaw agent works in isolation. ClawTeam transforms it into a multi-agent platform.

| Capability | OpenClaw Alone | OpenClaw + ClawTeam |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Task assignment** | Manual per-agent messaging | Leader autonomously splits, assigns, monitors |
| **Parallel development** | Shared working directory | Isolated git worktrees per agent |
| **Dependencies** | Manual polling | `--blocked-by` with auto-unblock |
| **Communication** | Only through AGI relay | Direct point-to-point inbox + broadcast |
| **Observability** | Read logs | Kanban board + tiled tmux view |

Once the skill is installed, talk to your OpenClaw bot in any channel:

| What you say | What happens |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Create a 5-agent team to build a web app" | Creates team, tasks, and spawns 5 agents with the configured backend |
| "Launch a hedge-fund analysis team" | `clawteam launch hedge-fund` with 7 agents |
| "Check the status of my agent team" | `clawteam board show` with kanban output |

## Per-Agent Model Assignment

Assign different models to different agent roles for better cost/performance tradeoffs in multi-agent swarms. Uses a **7-level priority chain**: CLI > agent model > agent tier > template strategy > template model > config default > None.

**Per-agent model in templates:**
```toml
[template]
name = "my-team"
command = ["openclaw"]
model = "sonnet-4.6"              # default for all agents
model_strategy = "auto"           # or: leaders→strong, workers→balanced

[template.leader]
name = "lead"
model = "opus"                    # override for leader

[[template.agents]]
name = "worker"
model_tier = "cheap"              # cost tiers: strong / balanced / cheap
```

**CLI flags:**
```bash
clawteam spawn --model opus                          # single agent
clawteam launch my-template --model gpt-5.4          # override all agents
clawteam launch my-template --model-strategy auto     # auto-assign by role
```

## Zirflow Contributions

This fork is actively maintained by [Zirflow](https://zirflow.com). Our contributions focus on production reliability, race condition fixes, and enterprise hardening.

### Production Reliability Fixes (v0.3.1-zr1)

| Component | Fix | Impact |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| `team/manager.py` | `add_member` / `remove_member` protected by `file_locked` | Concurrent spawn race condition eliminated |
| `team/manager.py` | New `set_budget()` method with locking | Concurrent budget update race condition fixed |
| `spawn/registry.py` | `unregister_agent` protected by `file_locked` | Worker unregistration race fixed |
| `workspace/manager.py` | `create_workspace` / `cleanup_workspace` protected | Workspace registry corruption prevented |
| `spawn/prompt.py` | Worker inbox polling loop added | Workers now properly receive follow-up tasks |

### Our Production Stack

This fork is battle-tested in Zirflow's production environment with:
- **OpenClaw** as the orchestration backbone
- **Feishu** (Lark) integration for team communication
- **n8n** workflow automation
- **Git worktree** isolation per agent
- **tmux** backend for process management

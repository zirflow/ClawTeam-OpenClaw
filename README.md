> **Fork of [HKUDS/ClawTeam](https://github.com/HKUDS/ClawTeam)** with deep OpenClaw integration: default `openclaw` agent, per-agent session isolation, exec approval auto-config, and production-hardened spawn backends. All upstream fixes are synced.

You set the goal. The agent swarm handles the rest — spawning workers, splitting tasks, coordinating, and merging results.

Works with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) (default), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), and any CLI agent.

---

## Why ClawTeam?

Current AI agents are powerful but work in **isolation**. ClawTeam lets agents self-organize into teams — splitting work, communicating, and converging on results without human micromanagement.

| | ClawTeam | Other multi-agent frameworks |
|---|---------|----------------------------|
| **Who uses it** | The AI agents themselves | Humans writing orchestration code |
| **Setup** | `pip install` + one prompt | Docker, cloud APIs, YAML configs |
| **Infrastructure** | Filesystem + tmux | Redis, message queues, databases |
| **Agent support** | Any CLI agent | Framework-specific only |
| **Isolation** | Git worktrees (real branches) | Containers or virtual envs |

---

## How It Works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%">

### Agents Spawn Agents
The leader calls `clawteam spawn` to create workers. Each gets its own **git worktree**, **tmux window**, and **identity**.

```bash
clawteam spawn --team my-team \
  --agent-name worker1 \
  --task "Implement auth module"
```

</td>
<td width="33%">

### Agents Talk to Agents
Workers check inboxes, update tasks, and report results — all through CLI commands **auto-injected** into their prompt.

```bash
clawteam task list my-team --owner me
clawteam inbox send my-team leader \
  "Auth done. All tests passing."
```

</td>
<td width="33%">

### You Just Watch
Monitor the swarm from a tiled tmux view or Web UI. The leader handles coordination.

```bash
clawteam board attach my-team
# Or web dashboard
clawteam board serve --port 8080
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Let the Agent Drive (Recommended)

Install ClawTeam, then prompt your agent:

```
"Build a web app. Use clawteam to split the work across multiple agents."
```

The agent auto-creates a team, spawns workers, assigns tasks, and coordinates — all via `clawteam` CLI.

### Option 2: Drive It Manually

```bash
# Create a team
clawteam team spawn-team my-team -d "Build the auth module" -n leader

# Spawn workers — each gets a git worktree + tmux window
clawteam spawn --team my-team --agent-name alice --task "Implement OAuth2 flow"
clawteam spawn --team my-team --agent-name bob   --task "Write unit tests for auth"

# Watch them work
clawteam board attach my-team
```

### Supported Agents

| Agent | Spawn Command | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) | `clawteam spawn tmux openclaw --team ...` | **Default** |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) | `clawteam spawn tmux claude --team ...` | Full support |
| [Codex](https://openai.com/codex) | `clawteam spawn tmux codex --team ...` | Full support |
| [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) | `clawteam spawn tmux nanobot --team ...` | Full support |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.com) | `clawteam spawn subprocess cursor --team ...` | Experimental |
| Custom scripts | `clawteam spawn subprocess python --team ...` | Full support |

---

## Install

### Step 1: Prerequisites

ClawTeam requires **Python 3.10+**, **tmux**, and at least one CLI coding agent (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, etc.).

**Check what you already have:**

```bash
python3 --version   # Need 3.10+
tmux -V             # Need any version
openclaw --version  # Or: claude --version / codex --version
```

**Install missing prerequisites:**

| Tool | macOS | Ubuntu/Debian |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Python 3.10+ | `brew install python@3.12` | `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip` |
| tmux | `brew install tmux` | `sudo apt install tmux` |
| OpenClaw | `pip install openclaw` | `pip install openclaw` |

> If using Claude Code or Codex instead of OpenClaw, install those per their own docs. OpenClaw is the default but not strictly required.

### Step 2: Install ClawTeam

> **⚠️ Do NOT run `pip install clawteam` or `npm install -g clawteam` directly:**
> - `pip install clawteam` installs the upstream PyPI version, which defaults to `claude` and lacks OpenClaw adaptations.
> - `npm install -g clawteam` installs an unrelated name-squatting package (by `a9logic`). If `clawteam --version` shows "Coming Soon", you have the wrong one — run `npm uninstall -g clawteam`.
>
> **Use the three commands below — the `pip install -e .` step is required. It installs from the local repo, not from PyPI.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/win4r/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git
cd ClawTeam-OpenClaw
pip install -e .    # ← Required! Installs from local repo, NOT the same as pip install clawteam
```

Optional — P2P transport (ZeroMQ):

```bash
pip install -e ".[p2p]"
```

### Step 3: Create the `~/bin/clawteam` symlink

Spawned agents run in fresh shells that may not have pip's bin directory in PATH. A symlink in `~/bin` ensures `clawteam` is always reachable:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
ln -sf "$(which clawteam)" ~/bin/clawteam
```

If `which clawteam` returns nothing, find the binary manually:

```bash
# Common locations:
# ~/.local/bin/clawteam
# /opt/homebrew/bin/clawteam
# /usr/local/bin/clawteam
# /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.*/bin/clawteam
find / -name clawteam -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

Then ensure `~/bin` is in your PATH — add this to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` if it isn't:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

### Step 4: Install the OpenClaw skill (OpenClaw users only)

The skill file teaches OpenClaw agents how to use ClawTeam through natural language. Skip this step if you're not using OpenClaw.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawteam
cp skills/openclaw/SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/clawteam/SKILL.md
```

### Step 5: Configure exec approvals (OpenClaw users only)

Spawned OpenClaw agents need permission to run `clawteam` commands. Without this, agents will block on interactive permission prompts.

```bash
# Ensure security mode is "allowlist" (not "full")
python3 -c "
import json, pathlib
p = pathlib.Path.home() / '.openclaw' / 'exec-approvals.json'
if p.exists():
    d = json.loads(p.read_text())
    d.setdefault('defaults', {})['security'] = 'allowlist'
    p.write_text(json.dumps(d, indent=2))
    print('exec-approvals.json updated: security = allowlist')
else:
    print('exec-approvals.json not found — run openclaw once first, then re-run this step')
"

# Add clawteam to the allowlist (use the absolute path — OpenClaw 4.2+ requires it)
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent "*" "$(which clawteam)"
```

> If `openclaw approvals` fails, the OpenClaw gateway may not be running. Start it first, then retry.

### Step 6: Verify

```bash
clawteam --version          # Should print version
clawteam config health      # Should show all green
```

If using OpenClaw, also verify the skill is loaded:

```bash
openclaw skills list | grep clawteam
```

### Automated installer

Steps 2–6 above are also available as a single script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/win4r/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git
cd ClawTeam-OpenClaw
bash scripts/install-openclaw.sh
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `clawteam: command not found` | pip bin dir not in PATH | Run Step 3 (symlink + PATH) |
| Spawned agents can't find `clawteam` | Agents run in fresh shells without pip PATH | Verify `~/bin/clawteam` symlink exists and `~/bin` is in PATH |
| `openclaw approvals` fails | Gateway not running | Start `openclaw gateway` first, then retry Step 5 |
| `exec-approvals.json not found` | OpenClaw never ran | Run `openclaw` once to generate config, then retry Step 5 |
| Agents block on permission prompts | Exec approvals security is "full" | Run Step 5 to switch to "allowlist" |
| `pip install -e .` fails | Missing build deps | Run `pip install hatchling` first |
| `clawteam --version` shows "Coming Soon" | Installed the npm name-squatting package (`a9logic`, unrelated to this project) | `npm uninstall -g clawteam`, then reinstall per Step 2 |

## Use Cases

### 1. Autonomous ML Research — 8 Agents x 8 GPUs

Based on [@karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch). One prompt launches 8 research agents across H100s that design 2000+ experiments autonomously.

```
Human: "Use 8 GPUs to optimize train.py. Read program.md for instructions."

Leader agent:
├── Spawns 8 agents, each assigned a research direction (depth, width, LR, batch size...)
├── Each agent gets its own git worktree for isolated experiments
├── Every 30 min: checks results, cross-pollinates best configs to new agents
├── Reassigns GPUs as agents finish — fresh agents start from best known config
└── Result: val_bpb 1.044 → 0.977 (6.4% improvement) across 2430 experiments in ~30 GPU-hours
```

Full results: [novix-science/autoresearch](https://github.com/novix-science/autoresearch)

### 2. Agentic Software Engineering

```
Human: "Build a full-stack todo app with auth, database, and React frontend."

Leader agent:
├── Creates tasks with dependency chains (API schema → auth + DB → frontend → tests)
├── Spawns 5 agents (architect, 2 backend, frontend, tester) in separate worktrees
├── Dependencies auto-resolve: architect completes → backend unblocks → tester unblocks
├── Agents coordinate via inbox: "Here's the OpenAPI spec", "Auth endpoints ready"
└── Leader merges all worktrees into main when complete
```

### 3. AI Hedge Fund — Template Launch

A TOML template spawns a complete 7-agent investment team with one command:

```bash
clawteam launch hedge-fund --team fund1 --goal "Analyze AAPL, MSFT, NVDA for Q2 2026"
```

5 analyst agents (value, growth, technical, fundamentals, sentiment) work in parallel. Risk manager synthesizes all signals. Portfolio manager makes final decisions.

Templates are TOML files — **create your own** for any domain.

## OpenClaw Integration

This fork makes [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) the **default agent**. Without ClawTeam, each OpenClaw agent works in isolation. ClawTeam transforms it into a multi-agent platform.

| Capability | OpenClaw Alone | OpenClaw + ClawTeam |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Task assignment** | Manual per-agent messaging | Leader autonomously splits, assigns, monitors |
| **Parallel development** | Shared working directory | Isolated git worktrees per agent |
| **Dependencies** | Manual polling | `--blocked-by` with auto-unblock |
| **Communication** | Only through AGI relay | Direct point-to-point inbox + broadcast |
| **Observability** | Read logs | Kanban board + tiled tmux view |

Once the skill is installed, talk to your OpenClaw bot in any channel:

| What you say | What happens |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Create a 5-agent team to build a web app" | Creates team, tasks, spawns 5 agents in tmux |
| "Launch a hedge-fund analysis team" | `clawteam launch hedge-fund` with 7 agents |
| "Check the status of my agent team" | `clawteam board show` with kanban output |

## Per-Agent Model Assignment (Preview)

> **Branch:** [`feat/per-agent-model-assignment`](https://github.com/win4r/ClawTeam-OpenClaw/tree/feat/per-agent-model-assignment)
>
> This feature is available for early testing on a separate branch. It will be merged into `main` once the companion OpenClaw `--model` flag is shipped.

Assign different models to different agent roles for better cost/performance tradeoffs in multi-agent swarms.

```bash
# Install from the feature branch
pip install -e "git+https://github.com/win4r/ClawTeam-OpenClaw.git@feat/per-agent-model-assignment#egg=clawteam"
```

**Per-agent model in templates:**
```toml
[template]
name = "my-team"
command = ["openclaw"]
model = "sonnet-4.6"              # default for all agents
model_strategy = "auto"           # or: leaders→strong, workers→balanced

[template.leader]
name = "lead"
model = "opus"                    # override for leader

[[template.agents]]
name = "worker"
model_tier = "cheap"              # cost tiers: strong / balanced / cheap
```

**CLI flags:**
```bash
clawteam spawn --model opus                          # single agent
clawteam launch my-template --model gpt-5.4          # override all agents
clawteam launch my-template --model-strategy auto     # auto-assign by role
```

See [issue #1](https://github.com/win4r/ClawTeam-OpenClaw/issues/1) for the full feature request and discussion.

Use when the user wants to create agent teams, spawn multiple agents to work in parallel, coordinate tasks with dependencies, broadcast messages between agents, monitor progress via kanban board, or launch pre-built team templates (hedge-fund, code-review, research-paper). ClawTeam uses git worktree isolation + tmux + filesystem-based messaging. Trigger phrases: team, swarm, multi-agent, clawteam, spawn agents, parallel agents, agent team."

# ClawTeam — Multi-Agent Swarm Coordination

## Overview

ClawTeam is a CLI tool (`clawteam`) for orchestrating multiple AI agents as self-organizing swarms. It uses git worktree isolation, tmux windows, and filesystem-based messaging. OpenClaw is the default agent backend.

**CLI binary**: `clawteam` (installed via pip, available in PATH)

## Quick Start

### One-Command Template Launch (Recommended)

```bash
# Launch a pre-built team from a template
clawteam launch hedge-fund --team fund1
clawteam launch code-review --team review1
clawteam launch research-paper --team paper1
```

### Manual Team Setup

```bash
# 1. Create team with leader
clawteam team spawn-team my-team -d "Build a web app" -n leader

# 2. Create tasks with dependencies
clawteam task create my-team "Design API schema" -o architect
# Returns task ID, e.g., abc123

clawteam task create my-team "Implement auth" -o backend --blocked-by abc123
clawteam task create my-team "Build frontend" -o frontend --blocked-by abc123
clawteam task create my-team "Write tests" -o tester

# 3. Spawn agents (each gets its own tmux window + git worktree)
clawteam spawn -t my-team -n architect --task "Design the API schema for a web app"
clawteam spawn -t my-team -n backend --task "Implement OAuth2 authentication"
clawteam spawn -t my-team -n frontend --task "Build React dashboard"

# 4. Monitor
clawteam board show my-team        # Kanban view
clawteam board attach my-team      # Tmux tiled view (all agents side-by-side)
clawteam board serve --port 8080   # Web dashboard
```

## Command Reference

### Team Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `clawteam team spawn-team <name> -d "<desc>" -n <leader>` | Create team |
| `clawteam team discover` | List all teams |
| `clawteam team status <team>` | Show team members and info |
| `clawteam team cleanup <team> --force` | Delete team and all data |

### Task Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `clawteam task create <team> "<subject>" -o <owner> [-d "<desc>"] [--blocked-by <id>]` | Create task |
| `clawteam task list <team> [--owner <name>]` | List tasks (filterable) |
| `clawteam task update <team> <id> --status <status>` | Update status |
| `clawteam task get <team> <id>` | Get single task |
| `clawteam task stats <team>` | Timing statistics |
| `clawteam task wait <team>` | Block until all tasks complete |

**Task statuses**: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`

**Dependency auto-resolution**: When a blocking task completes, dependent tasks automatically change from `blocked` to `pending`.

### Agent Spawning

```bash
# Default: spawns openclaw tui in tmux with prompt
clawteam spawn -t <team> -n <name> --task "<task description>"

# Explicit backend and command
clawteam spawn tmux openclaw -t <team> -n <name> --task "<task>"
clawteam spawn subprocess openclaw -t <team> -n <name> --task "<task>"

# With git worktree isolation
clawteam spawn -t <team> -n <name> --task "<task>" --workspace --repo /path/to/repo
```

Each spawned agent gets:
- Its own tmux window (visible via `board attach`)
- Its own git worktree branch (`clawteam/{team}/{agent}`)
- An auto-injected coordination prompt (how to use clawteam CLI)
- Environment variables: `CLAWTEAM_AGENT_NAME`, `CLAWTEAM_TEAM_NAME`, etc.

## JSON Output

Add `--json` before any subcommand for machine-readable output:

```bash
clawteam --json task list my-team
clawteam --json team status my-team
```

## Typical Workflow

1. **User says**: "Create a team to build a web app"
2. **You do**: `clawteam team spawn-team webapp -d "Build web app" -n leader`
3. **Create tasks**: Use `clawteam task create` with `--blocked-by` for dependencies
4. **Spawn agents**: Use `clawteam spawn` for each worker
5. **Monitor**: Use `clawteam board show` to check progress
6. **Communicate**: Use `clawteam inbox broadcast` for team-wide updates
7. **Cleanup**: `clawteam team cleanup webapp --force` when done

## Leader Orchestration Pattern

When YOU are the leader agent, follow this pattern to autonomously manage a swarm:

### Phase 1: Analyze & Plan
```
1. Understand the user's goal
2. Break it into independent subtasks
3. Identify dependencies between tasks (what must finish before what)
4. Decide how many worker agents are needed
```

### Phase 2: Setup
```bash
# Create team
clawteam team spawn-team <team> -d "<goal description>" -n leader

# Create tasks with dependency chains
clawteam task create <team> "Design API" -o architect
# Save the returned task ID (e.g., abc123)
clawteam task create <team> "Build backend" -o backend --blocked-by abc123
clawteam task create <team> "Build frontend" -o frontend --blocked-by abc123
clawteam task create <team> "Integration tests" -o tester --blocked-by <backend-id>,<frontend-id>
```

### Phase 3: Spawn Workers
```bash
# Each spawn launches an openclaw tui in its own tmux window
clawteam spawn -t <team> -n architect --task "Design REST API schema for <goal>"
clawteam spawn -t <team> -n backend --task "Implement backend based on API schema"
clawteam spawn -t <team> -n frontend --task "Build React frontend"
clawteam spawn -t <team> -n tester --task "Write and run integration tests"
```

### Phase 4: Monitor Loop
```bash
# Poll task status every 30-60 seconds
while true; do
  clawteam --json task list <team> | python3 -c "
import sys, json
tasks = json.load(sys.stdin)
done = sum(1 for t in tasks if t['status'] == 'completed')
total = len(tasks)
print(f'{done}/{total} complete')
if done == total: print('ALL DONE'); sys.exit(0)
"
  # Check for messages from workers
  clawteam inbox receive <team>
  sleep 30
done
```

### Phase 5: Converge & Report
```bash
# After all tasks complete:
clawteam board show <team>           # Final status
clawteam cost show <team>            # Total cost
clawteam workspace merge <team> --agent <name>  # Merge each worker's branch
clawteam team cleanup <team> --force  # Clean up
```

### Decision Rules for the Leader
- **Independent tasks** → spawn workers in parallel
- **Sequential tasks** → use `--blocked-by` to chain them; ClawTeam auto-unblocks
- **Worker asks for help** → check inbox, provide guidance via `inbox send`
- **Worker stuck** → check task status; if `in_progress` too long, send a nudge
- **Worker done** → verify result via inbox message, then move to next phase
- **All done** → merge worktrees, report to user, cleanup
